**Brief Introduction**

This repo is a static version of a project I have been participated in. I kept the parts I was mainly in charge, and then replace data from database with static data to make it run without backend.

The site was designed and developed on the basis of 1920 x 1080 display, so before entering the site please note that user experience on devices that do not qualify may be affected.
